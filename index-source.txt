<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

	This document specifies the values that should be used in the
	{{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute to encode the key's
	meaning. The {{KeyboardEvent/key}} value will differ based on the user's
	current locale. For a key value that is based only on the key's physical
	location and does not vary based on locale, see {{KeyboardEvent/code}}
	described in [[UIEvents-Code]].

	This specification was formerly titled <em>DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent
	{{KeyboardEvent/key}} Values</em>.

	<h3 id="style-conventions">Stylistic Conventions</h3>

		This specification uses the following conventions:

		*   The <a><em>key cap</em></a> printed on a key is shown as
			KEYCAP{&darr;}, KEYCAP{=} or KEYCAP{Q}. This is used to refer to a
			key from the user's perspective without regard for the
			{{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values in the
			generated {{KeyboardEvent}}.

		*   Glyphs representing character are shown as: GLYPH{&#x239C2;}.

		*   Unicode character encodings are shown as: UNI{\u003d}.

		*   Names of key values generated by a key press (i.e., the value of
			{{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}}) are shown as:
			KEY{ArrowDown}, KEY_NOLINK{=}, KEY_NOLINK{q} or KEY_NOLINK{Q}.

		*   Names of key codes associated with the physical keys (i.e., the
			value of {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/code}}) are shown as:
			CODE{ArrowDown}, CODE{Equal} or CODE{KeyQ}.

<h2 id="key-value-tables">Keyboard Event {{KeyboardEvent/key}} Value Tables</h2>

	This document defines the list of {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}}
	values which implementations MUST support, at a minimum, in addition to
	support for the full range of Unicode [[!Unicode]] codepoints. The
	{{KeyboardEvent/key}} attribute of an event MUST always contain one of these
	control key or character values (even if the value is KEY{Unidentified}). If
	the key represents one of the set of printable control characters which has
	a Unicode character entry, such as the tab key, the {{KeyboardEvent/key}}
	attribute MUST have the key value (e.g., KEY{Tab}).

	Implementations that are unable to identify a key MUST use the key value
	KEY{Unidentified}.

	<p class="warning">
	Conforming implementations MUST only use KEY{Unidentified} as a key value
	when there is no way for the implementation to detect the key value.
	Exposing only this value MUST NOT indicate a conforming implementation.
	</p>

	The <a>key values</a>
	defined in this specification are based in part on the sets of keycodes from
	the <code>java.awt.event.KeyEvent</code> interface of the Java Platform,
	Standard Edition 6 API Specification [[KeyEventJava]], and the
	<code>System.Windows.Forms.Keys</code> key enumeration of the Microsoft .NET
	Framework 4.0 Class Library [[KeysNet]]. Additional information in this spec
	comes from Microsoft's WM_APPCOMMAND messages [[WmAppCommand]], and other
	more specialized specifications as noted in this document.

	<p class="note">
	The keys on the numeric keypad (e.g., the keypad KEYCAP{1} key) do not
	generate distinct {{KeyboardEvent/key}} values from their non-keypad
	counterparts (e.g., the KEYCAP{1} key in the main part of the keyboard). The
	{{KeyboardEvent/location}} attribute can be used to determine if a key
	originated from the numeric keypad.
	</p>

	<div class="note">
		<b>Note:</b> There are special internationalization considerations for
		ECMAScript escaped characters.  CharMod conformance [[!CharMod]]
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C045">expects</a>
		the use of code points rather than surrogate pairs in escapes.
		ECMAScript escaped characters use surrogate pairs for characters outside
		the Basic Multilingual Plane (UNI{\uD84E\uDDC2} for GLYPH{&#x239C2;}, a
		Chinese character meaning <q>untidy</q>), rather than C-style
		fixed-length characters (UNI{\U000239c2} for GLYPH{&#x239C2;}) or
		delimited escapes such as Numeric Character References
		(<code>"&amp;#x239C2;"</code>). Characters escaped in this manner:

		*	are based on UTF-16 encoding, in that it uses surrogate pairs for
		    values outside the Basic Multilingual Plane
		*	are expressed using surrogate pairs, which makes it difficult for a
		    human to look up the value, and might require unnecessary overhead
		    for machine processing &mdash; this can also cause problems with
		    software written in the incorrect belief that Unicode is a 16-bit
		    character set
		*	are problematic for characters on supplementary planes (emoji, or
		    Chinese characters on plane 2), some of which are expected to be
		    input using a keyboard
		*	are not be suitable for Java or C, which use different escaping
		    mechanisms (could be solved with a normalizing method)
	</div>

	The following sub-sections contain the normative list of case-sensitive key
	values, their character values (where applicable), an informative
	description of typical usage, and an informative categorization.  A
	conforming implementation of the {{KeyboardEvent}} interface MUST support at
	least this set of values for use in the {{KeyboardEvent/key}} attributes,
	though not all values MAY be available on all platforms or devices.

	Future versions of this specification MAY include key values not included
	here, which have become common since the publication of this specification.
